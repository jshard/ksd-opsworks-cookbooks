# KSD OpsWorks Cookbooks

This repository contains the Chef cookbooks and recipes used by the
Kuali Service Delivery team at the University of Arizona to build and
configure Kuali-based service stacks using the Amazon Web Services
OpsWorks deployment management service.

To work with the contents of this repository, you should first
download and install the Chef Development Kit from:

    http://www.getchef.com/downloads/chef-dk/

Recent versions of ChefDK include a number of useful utilities
(e.g. Berkshelf, Test Kitchen, Foodcritic); if you have an older
ChefDK installed, you may have to do some additional gem installs to
get things working.
